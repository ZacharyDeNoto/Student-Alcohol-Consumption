# Student-Alcohol-Consumption

**Intro** - This project looks at information regarding students from ages 15 through 22. The goal was to see if the consumption of alcohol had any affect on students and if we could predict the alcohol consumption rate based on the factors. The dataset contained information such as fathers education, mothers education, access to internet, health of the student, weekday alcohol consumption, weekend alcohol consumption and more. 

**Tools** - Python, Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter Notebooks

**Data** - Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption

**Methods/Evaluation/Techniques** - Distributions, Model fitting, Visualizations

**Conclusion** - In conclusion it appears that there is a small correlation between age and the number of absences a student had. There also was a very high correlation between mothers and fathers education. Based on the factors of school support, family support, extra classes, activities, nursery, desire for higher education, if they have internet, and in a romantic relationship, it was easiest to predict if a student is a has a high alcohol consumption. Predicting students with low alcohol consumption were the next easiest to predict. For the rest of the alcohol consumption rates, it was more difficult to predict their consumption. It is easier to predict students alcohol consumption rate on the weekends compared to the weekdays, though it is not as accurate.
